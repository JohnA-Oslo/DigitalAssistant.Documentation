# Making contributions to the Unit4 People Platform documentation

This guide covers how you can contribute to the Unit4 People Platform documentation.

 > You must have a GitHub account to make contributions to the People Platform documentation.

The Unit4 People Platform documentation is hosted on GitHub and is open source with public-facing repositories. This allows the users of our products to contribute directly to our documentation and communicate with our developer teams via pull requests.

You can make two types of contribution to the Unit4 People Platform documentation:

- Quick edits where you want to make minor edits to a topic such as fix a type of correct a sentence etc.
- Bigger contributions where you want to add one or more new topics
## Making quick edits to existing topics

Making quick edits to topics makes it faster and simpler to report and fix small errors and omissions in documents such as small typos or incomplete or inaccurate sentences. Each topic features an **Edit this topic** button allowing you to open the file for editing.

You make a  quick edit to a topic as follows:

1. Click the **Edit this topic** button to open the source file on GitHub. If the **Edit this topic** button, that means the topic is not available to be changed.
2. Next, click the pencil icon, to edit the topic as shown below. If the pencil icon is grayed out, you need to either sign in to your GitHub account or create a new account.

3. Make your changes in the web editor. Click the _**Preview changes**_ tab if you want to check the formatting of your change.

4. Once you're happy with your changes, scroll to the bottom of the page, enter a title and description for your changes and click **Propose file changes**.

5. Now that you've proposed your change, you need to create a pull request to ask the owners of the repository to "pull" your changes into their repository. If you're new to GitHub, see [About Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) for more information.. When you clicked on **Propose file change** in the figure above, you should have been taken to a new page that looks like this:

6. Click **Create pull request**, enter a title (and optionally a description) for the pull request, and then click **Create pull request** again. 

**Once you've submitted your pull request**

Once you've submitted your pull request a Unit4 team member will review and merge your PR if it looks good, or you might get some feedback with requests for other changes or proposals for alternative changes etc..

The GitHub editing UI responds to your permissions on the repository. The preceding images are accurate for contributors that do not have write permissions to the target repository. GitHub automatically creates a fork of the target repository in your account. If you have write-access to the target repository, GitHub creates a new branch in the target repo. The branch name has the form <GitHubId>-patch-n using your GitHub ID, and a numeric identifier for the patch branch.
